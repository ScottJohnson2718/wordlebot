// wordlebot search strategy doesn't favor the solution words as guesses

// For small search spaces, have it look ahead and do the whole solution tree and return
// the likelihood of each guess. Try changing SolvePuzzle to return the chance that the given
// guess is the solution. Or make a new function that returns the chance.

// I keep thinking I'm going to write a strategy that looks ahead moves. There are too many guessing words
// for that. I either have to prune the guessing words by entropy (?) or prune the whole dictionary of words.
// I can make a dictionary of guessing words per opening word. So if the opening word is "slate" I can load
// slate.txt and use only the guessing words that are selected for some solution word.
